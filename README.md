# ⚓️ AnchorFlow

**Real-time fiat corridor health monitoring and smart routing for Stellar anchors.**

AnchorFlow continuously probes anchors across every registered corridor, aggregates live fee and reliability data, and exposes a routing API that always returns the best available anchor for a given asset pair and destination country. A Soroban smart contract acts as the on-chain source of truth — health attestations are written every epoch and queryable by any contract on Stellar, with no trust in AnchorFlow's server required.

## The Problem

Stellar's anchor network enables fiat settlement across 60+ countries, but it is largely unmonitored. Developers often hardcode one anchor per corridor and have little visibility when a service degrades. SEP-24 flows can silently fail, fee estimates drift over time, and there is no public infrastructure that tells developers or end users:

- Whether a corridor is operational
- Which anchor currently offers the best route
- What the real cost of a transfer is
- How reliable a corridor has been historically
- Which fallback route should be used when an anchor is unavailable

AnchorFlow solves this visibility gap.

## What AnchorFlow Does

| Without AnchorFlow | With AnchorFlow |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| HTTP 503 errors with no fallback | Automatic rerouting to the healthiest anchor |
| Fee data becomes outdated | Live normalized fee monitoring |
| One hardcoded anchor per corridor | Dynamic routing based on health scores |
| No reliability history | On-chain audit trail of anchor performance |
| Corridor outages discovered by users | Continuous proactive monitoring |

## Soroban Contract

The Soroban contract serves as the trust-minimized source of truth for anchor health data.

### Core Components

#### Anchor Registry

Stores registered anchors and supported corridors.

#### Health Attestations

Stores signed health scores submitted every monitoring epoch.

#### Routing Hints

Provides route recommendations directly on-chain.

| `get_health(anchor_id)` | Retrieve latest health score |
| `get_route(asset, country_code)` | Return highest-ranked route |
| `list_anchors(asset)` | List compatible anchors |
| `health_history(anchor_id, from, limit)` | Retrieve historical health data |

---

## REST API

## Validated Need

As of June 2026, there is no public infrastructure dedicated to monitoring Stellar anchor health, corridor availability, and real-time routing quality.

Developers frequently encounter:

- Silent corridor failures
- Unexpected fee changes
- Degraded SEP-24 experiences
- Missing fallback routes
- Limited visibility into anchor reliability

AnchorFlow provides the missing observability layer for the Stellar ecosystem by making anchor performance transparent, measurable, and verifiable.

Just as blockchain ecosystems rely on price oracles for trustworthy market data, Stellar applications need trustworthy infrastructure data to route payments effectively.

---

## Future Roadmap

### Phase 1

- Anchor monitoring engine
- Health scoring system
- REST API
- Dashboard

### Phase 2

- Soroban health attestations

- Decentralized attestation network
- Reputation system
- Multi-region monitoring nodes

### Phase 4

- Predictive corridor health
- AI-assisted routing recommendations
- Enterprise SLA monitoring
